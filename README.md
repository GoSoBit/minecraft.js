# minecraft.js
Launching minecraft, with JavaScript :O

### Tech Stack
* Building with webpack
* Running the JS with electron
* Writing the app with angular in ES6
* Open questions are distribution and installation/updating

### Goals
* Make an easily hackable minecraft-launcher with javascript
* Use the technicpack.net api for modpack installation *(others to follow)*
* Allow the use of themes and preset setting/modapcks *(so others can brand the launcher without creating oh so many forks)*
* Implement new tech that's not yet used in the minecraft(launcher) world
### Contributing
Although I'm fairly sure I can pull this of, all help is appreciated. If you don't are the developing kind of person, please give your input in the issues / [on waffle](http://waffle.io/Isigiel/minecraft.js).

If you want to contribute code-wise, just fork the project and pull request after you made your changes.

Most of work for me is the node.js part of the app, (handling file downloads / caching / launching mc).
